If I could be an animal I'd probably be a lungfish because I like waking up to rain.

I'm a science writer and editor who is interested in the stories we tell ourselves about science: how we construct them, how the sociocultural zeigeist influences it, how our humanity— our fears, hopes and passions— inexorably bleed into it. I won the inaugural [National Academy of the Sciences Schmidt Award for Excellence in Science Communication](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/national-academies-announce-inaugural-recipients-of-eric-and-wendy-schmidt-awards-for-excellence-in-science-communications-totaling-600000/) for a piece about how the [cultural anxiety of Victorian England shaped the natural history of the bee orchid](https://caltechletters.org/viewpoints/orchids-science-and-culture), and another about the [hope, grief and ambivalence of facing climate change through childhood memories of Northern California’s kelp forests](https://www.thexylom.com/post/no-more-free-kelp-in-northern-california). 
I'm also a regular contributor to [Oceanbites](https://oceanbites.org/author/ftan/) where I explain current marine biology research with as many bad puns as possible.

I recently graduated with a biology Ph.D. from Caltech, where I researched animal regeneration. My background is in evolution and development, studying all sorts of animal embryos to understand the amazing diversity of form in the natural world. 

If you like weird animals and are curious about the various ways we've felt and spoken about science, you should say hi on twitter, bluesky or mastodon. Tell me your favorite weird animal fact :)
